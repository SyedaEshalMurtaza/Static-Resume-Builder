# Static Resume Builder

This project is a **static resume builder** where users can enter their personal information, education, skills, and work experience into a form. Upon form submission, a preview of the resume is dynamically displayed. The form and preview are built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but the data is not saved or sent anywhere (no backend integration). It's a simple front-end solution to generate a resume on a single page.

## Features

- **Personal Information Section**: Enter your full name, email, phone number, and upload a photo.
- **Education Section**: Add details about your degree, school, and graduation year.
- **Skills Section**: List your skills.
- **Work Experience Section**: Add details about your work experience, including company name, role, and responsibilities.
- **Real-time Preview**: View a dynamic preview of your resume as you fill out the form.
- **Responsive Design**: The form and preview are designed to be responsive, looking good on both mobile and desktop screens.
- **CSS Styling**: Beautiful and modern design with rounded corners, hover effects, and a clean layout.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: For the structure of the resume and the form.
- **CSS**: For styling the form and the resume preview.
- **JavaScript**: For handling form submission and dynamically updating the resume preview.
- **Google Fonts**: For the "Mali" font used in the project for a stylish design.
